                       students and support from community members. By the 1970s, the library had outgrown its original 
                       building and plans began for a new building. </p>

                <p>I learned different components to execute fundraising events and led in organizing volunteer locations
                     for incoming students. These skills are transferable in my career of scheduling appointments, 
                      therapeutic protocols for each patient,
                     tackling research questions, and leading focus groups to obtain data about a research question.
                    <br><br>
                    I started NEF with Dr. Sylvia Imler and Mrs. Cheryl Levy, who taught me about accountability, respect, 
                    and becoming an effective communicator. The program continued with Brenda Scott, who furthered my skill in the 
                    relationship between a mentor and a mentee. The Navarro Executive Fellows Program impacted me as an undergraduate
                     student, my character development, and how I connect with people. Donquail Mims currently leads the program and
                      will continue to take the NEF
                     program further to help students grow as professionals as I was able to do in my career. </p>

                <p>At Youngstown State University, I participated in YSTAR, A.I.M, and NEF (Navarro Executive Fellows). 
                    All these programs are exceptional, but the most beneficial to me in my college career is the
                     Navarro Executive Fellows program. 
                     It has helped to take me out of my comfort zone and be more social. 
                     Rather than being my usual introverted self, I have found an extremely reliable and 
                     encouraging support system, 
                    who have helped me to feel included and accepted even when I felt like I didn’t belong.
                <br><br>
                YESS was also a massive help as it introduced me to my Executive, Carol Bennett, and gave me resources and 
                connections on campus. It has allowed me to network on campus and provided me a sense of belonging while 
                learning to problem solve. I have learned the value of working with a team. At the same time, I was 
                 the benefits of coming out of my shell.
                 I struggled with the challenge of working out things with roommates.</p>
