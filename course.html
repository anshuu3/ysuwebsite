                     Early students at Youngstown College used a small library collection in Jones Hall and the public library
                      on Wick Avenue. The University's first library (now Tod Hall) was built in 1953 after much fundraising by
                       students and support from community members. By the 1970s, the library had outgrown its original 
                       building and plans began for a new building. </p>
